# MC Privacy Policy
MC tracks and saves certain data about servers, users, and messages which are important for proper functionality.

MC requires your discord bot key to run (obviously)
MC also requires the username and api key of a challonge account, as it is with the challonge api that the tournaments are hosted and recorded.

MC (will, in the future,) track assignable roles to identify persons with the correct permissions to execute its functions.
MC requires certain role permissions in order to moderate and effectively communicate with tournament participants.
MC tracks the names and user ids of tournament participants for the purpose of accurately hosting tournaments.

MC (will, in the future,) track user command use frequency. It does so by saving the user id of interacters into its cache. 
If a user attempts to use MC too often within a 1-minute period, MC will save their ID into a blacklist which prevents the user from using MC's features. 
After a certain time frame, that user's ID will then be removed from the cache from which it saves the ID.
